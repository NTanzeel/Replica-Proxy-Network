# CS347 Project #

## Description ##

This repository contains a simplifed implementation of Primary-Backup Object Replications in Java using a passive backup scheme via a Replica Proxy implementation, as part of the CS347 coursework.

The protocol is presented as a simple buy and sell system, which in this case uses the notion of stocks to demonstrate a proxy based fault tolerant system
